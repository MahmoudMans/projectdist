I have been part of the precedent club GDSC SMU 2021-2022 and that inspired me to learn more about advaced technology , and made me realize that I am capable of acheiving goals. GDSC would impact me by letting my creativity to spread knowing that my ambition is to developp my knowledge in GOOGLE TECNOLOGIES, will impact and help other students to get out of their confort zone and become the developper of tomorrow.

I became a GO MY CODE lead instructor in 2021 due to my ability to learn fast, and that gave me the opporutnity to form new instuctors creating a team spirit.
What was challenging for me was solving problems despite being confronted to diffrent characters, some were stuborn, others were understanding.
I have to say that the best part of being a leader fo me was feeling responsible of the team I supervised and finalybeing proud of the hard work of everybody.

In my opinion, Cloud technolgies have alwyas been the most intersting technology created because it's one of the newly and modern developped. 
I discovered it while being a member of GDSC SMU 2021-2022, with GOOGLE CLOUD and the different QWIKLABS provided with it.
I have been dealing with Machine learning and DEEPlearning technologies that I faced during BAMBOO GEEKS machine learning course, and I am planning to pursue a career in it.
My goal is to combine these 2 techologies (CLOUD and MACHINE LEARNIN).
